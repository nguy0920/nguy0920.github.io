		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus: </strong>
				What are the three componets of Web?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans: </strong>
				The three components of a web are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
				
		</p></li>
		<!-- Qus 2 -->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				Define version control and give one example.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				Version control is a system that record changes to a file/set of files. This way, you are able to recall specific versions of the files later. 

				An example of this would be Github.
			</p>

				<strong>Qus: </strong>
				What tag is used to create the title of a web page? Give an example.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans: </strong>
				The tag used to create the title of a webpage would the tag < title > tag. An example of this would be what I have right now as my title tag. </p>

				<p>It is set to "LIB2024 - QA - Vanessa Nguyen" and it is what is shown in the tab bar or windows bar. 
				
		</p></li>
		<!-- Qus 4 -->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				What tag is used to create a paragraph in html? Give an example.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				A tag that is used to create a paragraph is the paragraph tag. It looks like < p >. </p>

				<p> Here is an example of me using the paragraph tag to seperate this line of text from the above line. 
			</p>
		</li>
		<!-- Qus 5 -->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus: </strong>
				Identify the odd one from these tags: < span >, < p >, < a >, < i >  and state the reason?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans: </strong> 
				The tag < a > is the odd tag because it cannot be used on its own. It is used to define hyperlink but requires a "href" attribute to work. This is unlike the other three elements which can stand on their own. 
				
		</p></li>
		<!-- Qus 6 -->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				What are the tags required to create a navigation list in HTML? 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				First you need to tag < nav > t create a navigation container. Then you need the tag < ul > which is the child of nav and is used to create navigation lists. The tag < l i > is used to create the lists, although it does not always need to be under the nav tag. 
			</p>
		</li>
		<!-- Qus 7 -->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus: </strong>
				What element is used to create images? Name its attributes. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans: </strong>
				The tag used to create an image tag is < img >. Its attributes consist of "src" which identifies the path to the image, such as where to take the image from your files, and the attribute "alt" which specifies the alternate text for the image in case the image cannot be reached. 
				
		</p></li>
		<!-- Qus 8 -->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				Identify the odd one from these tags: < table >, < tr >, < b >, < td >  and state the reason
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				The off one from the tags is < b > which is used to <b>bolden</b> text. It is the off one out because the other three elements are specifically used to create a table in HTML, while < b > is not.
			</p>

				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				Among HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, what language did you like the best? State the reason. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				I like HTML the most because it as what I used when tumblr was around back in the early 2010s so I had the time and luxury to play and learn it. Since everything else is new it's been difficult and a little stressful to learn--mainly because of everything else on my plate, but because of the actual code itself. I don't mind CSS, bu JQuery and Javascript was a rollercoaster. I specifically find HTML and CSS more straightforward and easier to understand, but again, that might be bcause we had more time to spend on it and i had some prior knowledge about it.
